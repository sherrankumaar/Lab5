# Lab 5 - Java's Non-Primitive Types 💻

This repository contains Java solutions for **Exercise 5** from Akademia Finansów i Biznesu Vistula. The tasks focus on various Java operations such as array manipulation, string handling, and palindrome checking.

## Tasks 📝

### Task 1 – Filling an Array
- **Objective:** Create a 10-element array and populate it with numbers from 9 to 0.
- **Implementation:** Use a classic `for` loop (leveraging the `.length` method) to fill the array and a `for-each` loop to display its contents.

### Task 2 – Finding Min and Max in an Array
- **Objective:** Generate a one-dimensional array with 10 random integers (ranging from 1 to 100) and find the smallest and largest values.
- **Implementation:** Use a loop to traverse the array and compare elements to determine the minimum and maximum.

### Task 3 – Two-Dimensional Array 10x10
- **Objective:** Create a 10x10 matrix, set the main diagonal with numbers from 0 to 9 (all other elements being 0), and compute the sum of the diagonal elements.
- **Implementation:** Use nested loops for matrix creation and a simple accumulation logic to sum the diagonal values.

### Task 4 – Concatenating Strings
- **Objective:** Read two strings from the user, concatenate them in both orders using the `concat()` method, and compare the results.
- **Implementation:** Use the `equals()` method for string comparison to check if the concatenated strings are identical.

### Task 5 – Is It Palindrome?
- **Objective:** Check whether a word input by the user is a palindrome.
- **Implementation:** Convert the input word to lowercase and compare it with its reverse to determine if it is a palindrome.
